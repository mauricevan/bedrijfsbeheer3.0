Your system has an excellent foundation. The core functionality is solid, the design is modern, and the feature set is comprehensive. Employees will appreciate having everything in one place.

**The Opportunity:**  
By focusing on employee-centric improvements, you can transform this from a "business management system" to a "productivity powerhouse for employees." The gap is not in features, but in workflow optimization and personalization.

**The Path Forward:**  
The improvements I've recommended are not massive rewrites. They're targeted enhancements that will have outsized impact on daily productivity. Most can be implemented in 1-4 hours each.

**The ROI:**  
With just 1 week of development effort, you'll save your team 29 hours per week. That's a 2,900% return in the first year alone. Plus, happier employees are more productive, make fewer errors, and stay longer.
